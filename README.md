# Cholera Prediction

This repository contains a project aimed at predicting cholera outbreaks using data science techniques. It leverages machine learning models to analyze various factors influencing cholera transmission and provides predictive insights to aid in proactive measures.

The project deploys data from the **World Health Organization (WHO)** on cholera outbreaks to predict which continents are at risk of future outbreaks.

## Project Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identifies patterns and relationships in cholera outbreak data.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans and prepares data for machine learning models.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Implements machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of cholera outbreaks.
- **Visualization:** Provides interactive plots and dashboards for data insights.
- **Deployment:** Includes scripts and resources for deploying the prediction model.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or above
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:Nahsc0/CholeraPrediction.git
   cd CholeraPrediction
   ```

2. Install required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook to explore the analysis and modeling steps:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

### Running the Project

1. Load and preprocess data using scripts in the `scripts/` directory.
2. Run the notebooks in the `notebooks/` folder to build and evaluate predictive models.
3. Visualize insights using tools in the `visualizations/` folder.

### Model Deployment

- Instructions for deploying the model using web frameworks (e.g., Flask, FastAPI) or cloud services will be added in future updates.
